# go-api-learning

This is a simple REST API I am creating in Go. It is my first project using the Go programming language, and I am using it to help learn the language.

## Installation and Setup

```bash
## Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/CallumB04/go-api-learning.git

## Run the server
cd go-api-learning && go run ./cmd/server
```
